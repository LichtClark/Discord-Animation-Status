# Discord-Animation-Status
This is a Simple Script that changes ur Discord Status automatically to your Current System Time!

This little Script will make a curl PATCH request that will change ur status.
I made a simple integer loop that the time gets constantly updated.

requirements are that u have a GNU-bash-Based shell with curl installed
you only need to instert your account token for updating with "REPLACE.YOURTOKENWITH.THIS"

if you want to have it less espnsive, lets say update every 1 minute remove the "#" before "#sleep 60"

get git bash:
